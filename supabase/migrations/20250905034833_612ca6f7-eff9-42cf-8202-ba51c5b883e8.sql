-- Fix RLS policy for trading_credentials table
-- Since this is a single-user trading application, we'll allow operations without authentication

-- Drop the existing restrictive policy

-- Create a more permissive policy for single-user trading application
CREATE POLICY "Allow trading credentials management" 
ON public.trading_credentials

-- Also update other trading tables to work without authentication for single-user setup

-- Keep the view-only policies for logs as they were
-- These are fine as system-level insertions
